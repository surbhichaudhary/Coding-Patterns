Grokking the Coding Interview Pattern

If you want to work on your algorithms and problem-solving skills, this is for you. Systematically, we will have easier problems to develop an understanding of the underlying solution patterns and then apply these patterns to solve difficult ones. 
You need to have a basic understanding of common data structures like Array, LinkedList, HashMap, Stack, Queue, Heap, and Graph. You should also be familiar with Big-O and Recursion.

This repo categorizes coding interview problems into a set of 28 patterns. Each pattern will be a complete tool - consisting of data structures, algorithms, and analysis techniques - to solve a specific category of problems. The goal is to develop an understanding of the underlying pattern, so that, we can apply that pattern to solve other problems.
